We used Arduino as a basis for creating the code which was then connected to the ‘SignBard’ glove for interpreting the gestures.

"0" represents the "default state," and "1" represents the "changed state," indicating the bending of the finger.
We successfully identified a set of non-repetitive and distinguishable gestures corresponding to specific words: "Love" (0,0,1), "Yes/Agreement/Confirmation" (1,1,1), "Unity" (1,0,0), the letter "D" (1,0,1), and the number "10" (0,1,1).
